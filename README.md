# Description
The Introduction to Data Ethics course wishes to discuss the main ethical aspects and criticalities emerging from the diffusion of decision methods based on the exploitation of large data collections. This issue is vigorously emerging in the IT sector, both in universities and in companies, with specific focus on algorithmic solutions, fully or semi-automatic, used to support, sometimes even to replace, an expert evaluation. Notable examples that produced a wide debate worldwide include applications in the area of law, finance, and corporate organization. In the last few years, the issue of Data Ethics has been included in several IT and non-IT academic degrees, both in Europe and in thre USA. It is also an active research field, an example of related conference is the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAT*). The organization of this course will be divided by themes, with for each theme, a presentation by the instructor of the documentation to analize (scientific papers, op-ed, surveys, sociotechnical analyses) followed by an open discussion among all participants, which will be required to read in advance the documentation and prepare observations for the discussion.
