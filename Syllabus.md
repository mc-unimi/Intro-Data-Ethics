# Syllabus of Introduction to Data Ethics

Every lesson, except the first one Introduction, will last 2 hours and 30 minutes and will be dedicated to analyze and discuss issues and problems raised by the suggested papers.
In the first 30 minutes (approximately) the instructor will summarize the main points of the papers and highlight the key open issues. Following this, students should elaborate on the open issues, possibly raise others, actively engage in open discussion and analyses. Together students should draw some conclusions and lesson learned at the end of the class.
